Performance-Based Advertising Case Study – CPC → CPO Switch Impact Analysis (Confidential)

Prepared by Emre Özyürek
Based on an anonymized B2B2C platform case study.
(All data derived from interview dataset; no confidential company data included.)

🧩 1. Business Context

X is a hybrid B2B2C price comparison platform that:

Helps consumers compare prices across retailers

Provides shops with scalable performance-based advertising

Ranks offers primarily by price → lower prices = higher positions = more visibility and traffic

Retailers choose between:

CPC (Cost-Per-Click) → pay per click

CPO (Cost-Per-Order) → pay only for completed conversions (fixed fee or % of basket value)

🤝 2. Case Setup

On 18 August 2023, partner DropItLikeItsHot (shops 10 & 463) switched from CPC → CPO.

In exchange, they committed to uploading significantly more inventory (OOP).

Your task:

Assess whether this deal was beneficial for X.
And evaluate impact on other shops and platform-level performance.

Timeline (as shown on page 4):

Pre-CPO: Jan 2023 – Aug 13, 2023

Transition Week (excluded): Aug 14–20, 2023

Post-CPO: Aug 21, 2023 – Aug 2024


📊 3. KPI Framework

From the KPI framework slide on page 5:


1️⃣ Conversion Rate (CR)
CR = Conversions / Clickouts

2️⃣ Revenue per Click (RPC)
RPC = Revenue / Clickouts

3️⃣ Inventory Commitment (OOP Growth)
OOP% = (OOP_post – OOP_pre) / OOP_pre

4️⃣ Revenue Growth
Rev% = (Rev_post – Rev_pre) / Rev_pre

5️⃣ Clickout Impact
Clickouts% = (CO_post – CO_pre) / CO_pre

🚀 4. Executive Summary (page 3)

According to the full KPI table on page 3:


KPI	Pre	Post	Change
Total Revenue	€294k	€1.38M	+370%
Conversion Rate	0.2–0.3%	11–13%	×40–80
RPC	€0.10	€0.12	+20%
Clickouts	2.79M	11.25M	+303%
Inventory (OOP)	432k	2.56M	+494%

Conclusion:

CPO switch was highly beneficial, generating +€1.08M incremental revenue for the platform.
All differences statistically significant (t-test p < 0.001).

📈 5. Weekly KPI Development (pp. 6–10)
📌 A) Conversion Rate

As shown on page 6:

Shop 10 → ×34 increase in CR

Shop 463 → ×83 increase


Traffic is not just higher — it converts significantly better.

📌 B) Revenue per Click (RPC)

(Page 7)


Shop 10: slight RPC dip (broader inventory, lower price buckets)

Shop 463: +45% RPC uplift (“value engine”)

Key insight:

Shop 10 = traffic engine
Shop 463 = monetization engine

📌 C) Revenue Growth

(Page 8)


Shop 10: €3.13k → €10.37k/week

Shop 463: €5.8k → €16.13k/week

Seasonality correctly appears (Q4 peak, Jan–Feb dip), showing this isn’t a one-off spike.

📌 D) Clickouts

(Page 9)


Shop 10: +482%

Shop 463: ~+100%

Platform-level traffic ALSO grows → no cannibalization observed.

📌 E) Inventory Commitment (OOP Growth)

(Page 10)


Shop 10: +875%

Shop 463: +189%

Combined: +494%

Formula confirmed in slides:

OOP ↑ → Traffic ↑ → Conversion ↑ → Revenue ↑

🧪 6. Segment & Category Performance (pp. 11–13)
✔ Category Uplift Drivers

(Page 11)


Shop 10:

Huge uplift in Haus & Garten, Mode & Accessoire

Best lift in €250–500 price segment

Shop 463:

Major uplift in Elektroartikel (mid/high price)

Insight:

Strong uplift concentrated in mid-price buckets (€50–500).

❌ Underperforming Segments

(Page 12)


Negative revenue segments all share:

Price ≤ €20

Low RPC

Low purchase intent

Recommendation:

Restrict uploads in <€20 bucket for Shop 463.

✔ Category Benchmarks

(Page 13)


No major vertical underperforms typical benchmarks

Confirms CPO scales efficiently

Uplift is quality-driven, not from cheap/low-value traffic

🌍 7. Platform-Level Impact (page 14)

Partner performance vs platform overall:


Traffic: 2.8M → 11.3M (+303%)

Conversions: 6k → 1.36M

Revenue: €294k → €1.38M (+4.7×)

Platform Revenue: €7.1M → €16.3M (+129%)

Partner Share: 4.1% → 8.5%

Critically:

✔ Other shops continued growing normally

→ No cannibalization observed.

🏁 8. Final Conclusion (page 15)

From the final conclusion table:


Was the deal beneficial to X?

Evidence:

Revenue: +338–422%

CR: 0.2–0.3% → 11–13%

RPC: stable / +45%

Traffic: +200–480%

OOP: +494%

Platform Revenue: +129%

Net Gain: +€1.08M
🔧 9. Next Steps (page 16)

Recommendations from slide:


Build weekly dashboard (CR, RPC, OOP, Share)

Boost ≤ €500 price buckets

Limit < €20 buckets

Maintain CPO for shops 10 & 463

Roll out CPO to 2–3 similar partners

Monitor Q4 2024 – Q1 2025 seasonality to confirm uplift persistence
